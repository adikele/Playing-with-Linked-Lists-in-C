In this program, I insert characters in a linked list in two different methods. In the first method, the new item is stored to the rear end of the linked list, and in the second method, it is stored in the front end of the list. Printing out the items stored shows the differences in the way they were stored.

In both the cases, the insertion function uses malloc () function to generate a newnode. Using malloc () function enables the program to allocate storage space as needed in response to demand.

Reviewing the two insertion functions, one notes that writing in C provides the user flexibility on filling a linked list.
